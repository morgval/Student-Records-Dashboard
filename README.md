# Student Records Management Web Dashboard
| Current Target Release |	1.2 |
| Status |	In Development |
| Developer	| @morgval |
| Credits	| [@CodAffection](https://github.com/CodAffection) for [Pure CRUD JS](https://github.com/CodAffection/Pure-JavaScript-CRUD-Operations-with-Html) which taught me more about JavaScript DOM methods than anything |

## Project Synopsis
The first attempt at the Student Records project used a functional approach rather than object oriented, as originally intended.  However, it should still perform the same as the original OOP version, but will not support as many user stories.  Only "must-have" priorities can be supported in this way without the program becoming more complex than possible for a single developer to sustain.  I may circle back further in my studies but am using the Functional approach, for now, to learn more about JavaScript ArrayLists and JSON dictionary compatibility.
The OOP approach was the original intention for the project but during my Capstone I wanted to explore a slightly different approach than what I had been taught originally.  After taking the basic steps in the Functional approach, now I want to recreate the original version also using JavaScript, since it has quickly become one of my favorite languages, and will help me focus on brushing up on using classes and class methods before learning React.
Whichever approach you would like to test, download the appropriate folder of code.  Each folder will have the appropriate README for running and working with.

## Project Requirements
MUST HAVE - basic requirements and purpose of the system
COULD HAVE - a part of project requirements but does not need to be implemented in MVP
WOULD HAVE - out of scope of project, but still viable functions to implement
